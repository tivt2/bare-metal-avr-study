# AVR(ATmega328P) bare-metal
This is an exploration on how to code bare-metal using the C language and also learn about MCUs using the AVR(ATmega328P).
Keep in mind that i am a novice at this.

This project will be separated into concepts with its corresponding example, where each example is built individualy, the build is a simple makefile utilizing the avr-toolchain to compile and flash to the mcu.

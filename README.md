# AVR(ATmega328P) bare-metal
This is an exploration on how to code bare-metal using the C language and also learn about MCUs using the AVR(ATmega328P), most of the information used to understand this can be found at the [ATmega328P datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf).
Keep in mind that i am a novice at this.

This project will be separated into enumerated concepts with its corresponding example, where each example is built individualy, the build system is a simple makefile utilizing the avr-toolchain to compile and flash to the mcu.
